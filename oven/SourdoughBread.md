This is a simple, no-knead recipe.

One annoying thing about the above linked recipe is that it assumes the baker has a gram-scale. :(  The recipe below is converted to US volume measurements for convenience. (Things that are difficult to make are not likely to be made often.)

## Starter and Starter Maintenance

After you have your starter 'going', you'll need to do weekly maintenance to keep it going. Every week, to the following:

1. Stir starter until it is homogenous.
1. Reserve 1/4 cup of starter in a measuring cup.
1. Dump the rest in your 'spare starter' jar and stir.
1. *Wash* the starter jar.
1. Put the 1/4 cup back in the jar.
1. Add 1/4 cup of room temperature water.
1. Add 1/4 cup of flour.
1. Stir
1. Refrigerate *both* jars for 1 hour.
1. Take the jars out of the fridge and store at room temperature until next week.

It's a good idea to wash the 'spare' jar once per month, and strain the spare starter back into the jar.  This will discourage the growth of other yeasts and molds just a bit.

Now **go bake bread**  with the 'spare starter'! :D
