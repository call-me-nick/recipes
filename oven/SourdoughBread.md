# Sourdough Bread

This is a simple, no-knead recipe.

One annoying thing about the above linked recipe is that it assumes the baker has a gram-scale. :(  The recipe below is converted to US volume measurements for convenience. (Things that are difficult to make are not likely to be made often.)

## Starter Maintenance

After you have your starter 'going', you'll need to do weekly maintenance to keep it going. Every week, to the following:

1. Stir starter until it is homogenous. There will likely be some 'hootch' on the top.
1. Reserve 1/4 cup of starter in a measuring cup.
1. Dump the rest in your 'spare starter' jar and stir.
1. *Wash* the starter jar.
1. Put the 1/4 cup back in the jar.
1. Add 1/4 cup of room temperature water.
1. Add 1/4 cup of flour.
1. Stir
1. Let both jars stand for an hour *after* coming to room temperature.
1. Put both in the fridge until next week.

The 'spare' jar could be left out on Friday night for the entire weekend, so it's ready to go when you want to bake. The yeast need to be at room temperature for awhile (hours) for it go get growing rapidly again.

It's a good idea to wash the 'spare' jar once per month, and strain the spare starter back into the jar.  This will discourage the growth of other yeasts and molds just a bit.

Now **go bake bread**  with the 'spare starter'! :D
