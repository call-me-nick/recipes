### Mix dry ingredients

In a medium bowl, mix:

| *ingredient* | *amount* |
| --- | --- |
| general purpose flour | 2 cups |
| salt | 1 teaspoon |
| baking powder | 1 tablespoon |

### Measure

| *ingredient* | *amount* |
| --- | --- |
| ghee | 1 tablespoon |
| water | 3/4 cups

### Procedure

* Add ghee to dry ingredients bowl and "fork" it in until it's the texture of cornmeal (small gains).
* **Slowly** add the water, tablespoon by tablespoon and mix until the dough comes together. Then **stop** adding water. Place on a lightly floured surface and knead a few minutes until smooth and elastic.
* Evenly divide the dough into balls. Start with 12, but you may want to either increase or decrease the size of the tortillas to your preference.
* Heat a flat-surfaced pan or griddle to a 'medium' heat.
* For each ball: 
  * Flatten and cook until light brown and bubbles form. 
  * Flip and do the other side.
  * Keep cooked tortillas warm.
