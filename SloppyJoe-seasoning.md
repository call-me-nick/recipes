# Sloppy Joe Seasoning

A home chef should be able to make a dry powder and use it when needed. It should last for a year or more, without worrying about it going bad. Unlike this recipe, most have things like ketchup or Worcestershire sauce.

When you have this in a jar, ready to go, you need only supply the appropriate mix of tomato paste, sugar and bouillon to have an excellent sauce.
