# Pumpkin Pie

This makes three 9" pies.  If you decide to make this from a fresh pumpkin, you'll have enough pie filling for many more pies than you dreamed, and a hand full of yummy pumpkin seeds.

## Preparing the Pumpkin

If you choose to use a fresh, raw pumpkin, do this. If you're using canned pumpkin, skip ahead to the **Pie** section.

| *ingredient* | *amount* |
| --- | --- |
| pumpkin | 1 small-medium |

A single pumpkin can make a LOT of pies. Get a small-to-medium one, so you don't end up with too much.

Think small. I'm not kidding! :D

1. Cut the pumpkin in half.
1. Cut out the stem from the top and slice off any useful meat.
1. Pull out the gooey guts. **Save those seeds** for later.
1. Lightly scrape the inside of the pumpkin to get the goo off.
1. Peel the skin off. (Slicing with a large knife works well.)
1. Cut the meat into 2" chunks.
1. Put those in a pot as if you're making mashed potatoes.
1. Add enough water to just cover.
1. Cover and bring to a boil.
1. Lower the heat to avoid boiling over.
1. Cook long enough so that a fork goes in to a piece very easily (like a mashed potato).
1. Drain.
1. Mash.
1. Puree using a blender or mixer.
1. Done!

### Seeds

The following is a recipe for making tasty and crunchy pumpkin seeds. They can be eaten whole. There's no need to remove the shell.

1. Put the seeds in a strainer and rinse off the goop.
1. Put the seeds into a quart (liter) of water that's been heavily salted.
1. Let those soak until the pie is done.

Continuing:

1. Drain (Do not rinse!).
1. Spread the seeds evenly on a clean cookie sheet.
1. Bake at 300F (~145C) and let them dry for about an hour.
1. Check the dryness by stirring them around with a spatula.
1. If they need a little more, bake them a bit more. They won't burn at such a low temperature.
1. Test dryness and crunchiness by eating one. Bake longer, if needed.
1. Enjoy!


## Pie

The following makes 3 deep-dish 9" pies.

You can make the crust and process the pumpkin yourself, or just use frozen pie shells and canned pumpkin. Either way works, but fresh is almost always best.

### Ingredients

| *ingredient* | *amount* |
| --- | --- |
| pie shells | 3 x 9" deep-dish |
| white sugar | 1 cup |
| brown sugar | 1 cup |
| cinnamon | 2.5 teaspoons |
| ginger | 3/4 teaspoon |
| nutmeg | 3/4 teaspoon |
| salt | 1/2 teaspoon |
| cloves | 1/2 teaspoon |
| vanilla | 2 tablespoons |
| eggs | 6 |
| mashed pumpkin | 3 cups |
| condensed milk | 2 x 12 Oz. cans. |

1. Preheat the oven to 400F (~200C).
1. Mix all dry ingredients in a **large** bowl.
1. Mix the eggs into the dry ingredients *__completely__*.
1. Add the milk and mashed pumpkin.
1. Mix well with a wire whip.
1. Pour into pie shells.

### Bake

1. Bake for 14 minutes at 400F (~200C).
1. **Lower** the heat to 350 (~175C) and bake for 50 minutes.
1. Check by inserting a knife into the pie. If it comes out clean, it's done.
