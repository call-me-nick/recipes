# Weight Management

## Weight Loss

* Goal: **No more** than 2 lbs/week
* Goal: **No more** than 6 lbs/month. (Take a week “off”, if you must. Obviously, eat reasonably.)
* Use one day, at the same-ish time of day, as your 'weight baseline'. Saturday morning, before breakfast can work well for this. Obsessing over daily weights can be counterproductive. However: noting how last-night's meal changed your weight may be useful.
* Remember: Being a little hungry is not much discomfort compared to SO many other things in the world that it should be fairly easy to endure.
* Set an eating hard-cutoff time in the evening. eg: “I won’t eat anyting after 7pm.”

## Sustainability

Success depends on sustainabilty, so avoid 'fad' diets. If you’re cutting out something you love, you won’t be successful.

* Remember that occasional surprise weight gain or loss is most likely due to your level of hydration.
* Drink lots of water!
* Limit fruit juice intake. A glass of applejuice can have as many as 5-8 apples in it. Who eats that many apples in a sitting?
* Eliminate soda from your diet. Nobody needs things like soda, hard candy, cake, etc. These are not food. These are treats and should be consumed like treats. (In very small quantities and rarely!)
* Eat unlimited nuts. Be mindful of your body’s reaction to salt, tho. Favor unsalted nuts.
* Fat is not a 'bad food'. It does not cause an insulin spike and make you hungry soon after, like simple sugars do. Make sure to eat lots of vegetable-y fats, and reduce the animal-derived fats. Cook everything with olive oil. Yum!
* If you're hungry and
    * know you don’t need food: brush your teeth. Maybe use Listerine to disrupt your tastebuds.
    * know you probably need something: eat a small amount of protein. Maybe a slice of lunchmeat or cheese?
    * know you probably need something, and you want a treat: eat a small piece of dark chocolate (70%+ coco).
* Get good sleep. Keep your sleeping pattern as regular as possible. Go to bed at the same time every day. Get up and get moving at the same time every day. Keep this pattern on weekends.
* Be careful with THC consumption. It's almost impossible to manage your food and drink intake with poorly timed THC use.


## Misc

* When you snack, make sure you take a small portion into a bowl and don't take the entire bag of chips with you to the couch.
* Try to eat more frequent small meals, rather than larger ones.
* Don't worry about following all of this rigidly.
* Weight loss is simple arithmetic. Calories in versus calories out. Eating the right things, at the right times, in the right portions makes it easier to maintain the equation.
