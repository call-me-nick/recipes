# Chili

## Prepare Beans

| *ingredient* | *amount* |
| --- | --- |
| kidney beans | 1 pound |

Sort the beans (take out the bad ones and any stones), rinse and put them in a bowl by themselves. Cover the beans with water and add another inch of water above that.

## Prepare Seasonings

In a bowl, get these ready to go.

| *ingredient* | *amount* |
| --- | --- |
| salt | 2 teaspoon |
| pepper | 1/2 teaspoon |
| chili powder | 2 tablespoons |
| cumin powder | 1 teaspoon |
| bouillon | 2 tablespoons |
| dried oregano | 1 teaspoon |

Prefer veggie "Better Than Bouillon".

## Saute

| *ingredient* | *amount* |
| --- | --- |
| onion | 1/2 |
| minced garlic | 1 tablespoon |
| poblano pepper | 1 large |
| celery | 3 stalks |
| butter or ghee | 3 tablespoons |
| olive oil | 4 tablespoons |

## Add Meat

| *ingredient* | *amount* |
| --- | --- |
| meat | 1 pound |

Pork (chunks), hamburger, chunks of chicken, ground turkey... Any of these will work.  It might even be good with paneer or tofu.

Our first try used chunks of boneless pork ribs. Yum!

Let the meat cook a little to a light brown. Don't worry if it's not cooked all the way thru. It will cook when it's under pressure later.

## Add

Add the seasonings and stir for a minute.

| *ingredient* | *amount* |
| --- | --- |
| diced tomatoes | two ~14 oz cans **or** fresh diced tomatoes |
| tomato sauce | one ~14 oz can |

Mix for a minute.

Dump in the beans **with** the water.

## Pressure Cook

Pressure cook for 18 minutes at high pressure and let it depressurize by itself naturally.
