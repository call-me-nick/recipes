# Chili

## Prepare Beans

| *ingredient* | *amount* |
| --- | --- |
| red beans | 2 cups dry beans |
| water | *See below. |

Sort the beans (take out the bad ones and any stones), rinse and put them in a 4 cup measuring cup and fill it to the 4 cup line with water. Soak until they're needed.

## Prepare Seasonings

In a bowl, get these ready to go.

| *ingredient* | *amount* |
| --- | --- |
| salt | 2 teaspoon |
| pepper | 1/2 teaspoon |
| chili powder | 2 tablespoons |
| cumin powder | 1 teaspoon |
| dried oregano | 1 teaspoon |
| dried celery | 3 tablespoons |
| bouillon | 2 tablespoons |

Prefer veggie "Better Than Bouillon".

## Saute

| *ingredient* | *amount* |
| --- | --- |
| onion | 1/2 |
| minced garlic | 1 tablespoon |
| poblano pepper | 1 large |
| butter or ghee | 3 tablespoons |
| olive oil | 4 tablespoons |
| *optional* bacon fat | 1/2 cup |

## Add Meat

| *ingredient* | *amount* |
| --- | --- |
| meat | 1 to 2.5 pound(s) |

Pork (chunks), soy curls (excellent!), beef chunks, chicken chunks, ground turkey, etc ... Any of these will work.  It might even be good with paneer.

Our first try used chunks of boneless pork ribs. Yum! Using a bag of soy curls came out really well, too.

Let the meat cook a little to a light brown. Don't worry if it's not cooked all the way thru. It will cook when it's under pressure later.

## Add

Add the seasonings and stir for a minute.

| *ingredient* | *amount* |
| --- | --- |
| diced tomatoes | two ~14 oz cans **or** fresh diced tomatoes |
| tomato sauce | one ~14 oz can |

Mix for a minute.

Dump in the beans **with** the water.

## Pressure Cook

Pressure cook for 35 minutes at high pressure and let it depressurize naturally.
