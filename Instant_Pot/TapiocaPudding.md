# Tapioca Pudding

This recipe uses 2 different sized tapioca pearls.  This adds a nice mixture of smooth and chewy and has an excellent 'mouth feel'.

## Prepare Ingredients

| --- | --- |
| *large* tapioca pearls (~1/4" or ~6mm) | 1/3 cup |

Get these soaking right away, in *hot* water, **45 minutes**.

Get the rest ready to go during the soak time.
