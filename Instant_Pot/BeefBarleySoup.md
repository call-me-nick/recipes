# Beef and Barley Soup

Loosely based on one of [Flo Lum's recipes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og0I5krYlM0).

## Prepare

| *ingredient* | *amount* |
| --- | --- |
| olive oil | 3 tablespoons |
| beef | 3/4 lbs of chuck or soup meat |
| onion | 1 white or yellow |
| garlic | 2 tablespoons minced |
| salt | 1/2 teaspoon |
| pepper | 1/4 teaspoon |
| thyme | 1 teaspoon |
| parsley | 2 teaspoons |
| celery | 2 thick stocks or 3 thin stocks |
| carrots | 4 large carrots |
| tomato paste | 2 tablespoons |
| barley | 3/4 cup |
| "Better Than Bouillon" veggie base | 2 tablespoons |
| water | 6 cups total |


* Start soaking the barley in 2 cups of water.
* Add the bouillon to 4 cups of hot water and set aside.
* Cube the beef ~1"
* Cut celery and carrots to large (~1") chunks into a bowl with the tomato paste on top.
* Chop the onion and place in a dish with the garic on top.
* Measure the dry spices into a dish.

## Saute

* Brown the beef in the olive oil. Be careful not to add too much meat at one time or it will go from `browning` to `steaming`. We want `browning`.
* Pull out the meat when browned.
* Add and saute the onions and garlic until the onions look rounded and slightly transparent.
* Add dry spices and saute until it smells good and is well mixed.
* Add veggies and saute for a minute or two until it's well mixed.
* Add barley with its water.
* Add bouillon with its water.
* Re-add the beef.

## Pressure Cook

* 20 minutes, high pressure
* Natural release or fast after 15 minutes cooldown.
