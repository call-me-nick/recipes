# Hummus

This starts with dried chickpeas. 

## Re-hydrate

Place raw chickpeas in water and baking soda **overnight**.

| *ingredient* | *amount* |
| --- | --- |
| dried chickpeas | 2 cups |
| water | 6 cups |
| baking soda | 1 teaspoon |

Dump out the water, after re-hydration.

## Prepare Spices

In a bowl:

| *ingredient* | *amount* |
| --- | --- |
| tahini | 1/4 cup |
| garlic | 2 cloves |
| lemon juice | 1/4 cup |
| salt | 1 teaspoon |
| olive oil | 4 tablespoons |
| cumin | 1 teaspoon |


## Pressure Cook

| *ingredient* | *amount* |
| --- | --- |
| water | 2 cups |

If you didn't soak the peas overnight, then you'll need to add more water to the recipe to get the consistency you want.

* Add water, spices, and peas to the pot.
* Stir.
* 50 minutes, high pressure
* Natural depressurize

## Finish

| *ingredient* | *amount* |
| --- | --- |
| citric acid | 1 teaspoon |

The citric acid adds that 'tang'. It also may cause extra moisture to rise
to the top of the refridgerated container.

Using a potato-masher, mash the beans into a paste. Divide into containers and put in the fridge and/or freezer.

## Options

* Go nuts with garlic! Add up to 3 times normal.
* Add 1/4 teaspoon smoked Paprika!
