## Final Preparation

| *ingredient* | *amount* |

The citric acid adds that 'tang'. It also may cause extra moisture to rise
to the top of the refridgerated container.

* Using a potato-masher, mash the beans into a paste.
* Squish the paste thru a strainer.
* Let it cool for ~2 hours. It will jell like cream of wheat cereal.
* Stir.
* Divide into containers and put in the fridge and/or freezer.
