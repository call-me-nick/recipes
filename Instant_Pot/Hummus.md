# Hummus

This starts with dried chickpeas. I could be made with canned and peeled chickpeas, as well.

NOTE: This recipe can take awhile, especially if you need to peel the chickpeas.

## Re-hydrate

Place raw chickpeas in water for an hour.

## Peel the Chickpeas

Chickpeas have a skin that can easily be squeezed off. Get comfortable. Get a friend. Be prepared to take some time peeling all of the peas.
