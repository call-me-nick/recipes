# Red Beans and Rice

This `Louisiana Style Red Beans and Rice` recipe is loosely based on [this YouTube vid by IHeartKake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8gfpKkSH-w)

You can make your own `Cajun Spice` using the recipe in this repo.

## Prepare Plain Rice

This works with pretty much any kind of plain rice. Do it how you like it, with whatever rice you like. We like `Rhee Chun` Korean style rice, grown near Sacramento, California.

## Soak Beans

Soak the beans until they're needed. 30 minutes to 24 hours. Or don't. :D
