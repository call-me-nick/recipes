# Black Eyed Peas

Based on a verbally shared 'recipe' from the chef at [C.O.D. Ranch ](https://www.codranch.com/) in Oracle, AZ. (Thank you!)

This recipe is **vegan**.

I hesitated to buy the 'smoked sea salt' at first, but it turns out it comes in a fairly small quanity and is quite nice.  It lends a somewhat "bacon-y" flavor to the dish.
