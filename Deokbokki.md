# Simple Deokbokki

Deokbokki is a staple Korean dish made mostly of thick rice noodles and the sweet-spicy Korean hot sauce.

This recipe works really well if you have 2 InstantPots, but neither are required. Ordinary pots on a stove will do the job.

The noodles/rice cake come in various shapes and sizes.
Two common examples:
  * silver dollar shaped
  * shaped like half of a thick sharpie pen
