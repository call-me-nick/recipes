# Hom Fried Rice

Yes, it's spelled correctly! We learned a fried rice recipe from the Hom family, and this is basically hacks on that one.

Ours makes use of an InstantPot, which makes rice cooking easy.

Thank you, Homs! :D

## Prepare Rice

The rice needs to be prepared ahead of time. It also needs to be cooked 'dry', so it won't stick to everything during the stir-fry. This is why it uses less water than rice that would simply be eaten.

We like Jasmine or Basmati rice for this recipe, since it can be pressure-cooked dryer than a Japanese or Korean sticky rice, for example.

1. Rinse rice at least twice in the pot or **thoroughly** with a sieve.
1. Add water (See above.)
1. Place in InstantPot.
1. Run the Rice program (10 min high pressure.)
1. Quick-depressurize.
1. Fluff with a fork
