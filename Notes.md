## Instant Pot

If you don't own one, you're really missing out. For excellent, repeatable, set-and-forget cooking, this is an amazing tool.  Here are links to the two I own:

* [6 quart Instant Pot Duo60](http://a.co/d/bgTezfE)
* [3 quart Instant Pot Lux Mini](http://a.co/d/8FuKMQR)

## Substitutes

For garlic cloves, I sometimes sub in minced garlic.
