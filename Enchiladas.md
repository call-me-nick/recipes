# Enchiladas

## Prepare

### Chop

| *ingredient* | *amount* |
| --- | --- |
| white or yellow onion | 1 |
| chicken | 1/2 chicken, cubed |

Pre-cooked chicken bits can also be used. Throw the skin (chopped fine) in there for extra flavor!

### Grate

| *ingredient* | *amount* |
| --- | --- |
| cheese | 3 cups grated |

Use your favorite cheese. Medium cheddar or a pre-grated Mexican blend are both good choices.

### Open

| *ingredient* | *amount* |
| --- | --- |
| enchilada sauce | 1 cup |

Or, make your own!

### Measure or Open

| *ingredient* | *amount* |
| --- | --- |
| salt | 1/2 teaspoon |
| pepper | 1/4 teaspoon |
| black beans | 1 15-oz can |
| green chili pepper | 1 4-oz can chopped (or fresh 1.5 cups) |
| tortillas (corn or flour) | 1 package fajita-sized (or adjust for your tortillas) |
| (optional) black olives | sliced into rings |

## Saute Filling

| *ingredient* | *amount* |
| --- | --- |
| olive oil or ghee | 3 tablespoons |

1. Add oil/ghee to a wok.
1. Heat wok on high.
1. Add onions (before it starts smoking) and saute until clear and shiny.
1. Add chicken. Cook "appropriately".
1. Add:
   * chilis
   * beans
   * salt
   * pepper
   * olives
1. Mix.
1. Turn off the heat and stir until no longer actively cooking.

## Assemble

It may be necessary to microwave the tortillas in batches of about 5 for 15 seconds to make them flexible.

In a large, rectangular baking pan:

1. Coat both sides of a tortilla with enchilada sauce
1. Add a heaping tablespoon of filling
1. Add a generous portion of grated cheese
1. Fold and hold while doing the next one.
1. Repeat until you run out of ingredients or out of room in your pan.

## Options

It would be possible to use soy-curls or some other meat in place of the chicken.  This would need to be pre-prepared appropriately.

If fresh green chilis are used, they should be added after the onions are sauted for a few minutes. Saute them until they get very soft. The onions and chilis will likely finish at the same time, if the chilis are put in about half way thru onion saute process.
