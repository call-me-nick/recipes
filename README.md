# Recipes

This is a collection of personal recipes.

Most of these recipes came from someone else, but have been changed in different ways to suit our tastes or needs.

The Pumpkin Pie recipe is an old one with some special requirements that we had, at the time.  Take a look. It's kind of an interesting story.

## Notes

The following are notes that may be useful to the reader.

### Instant Pot

If you don't own one, you're really missing out. For excellent, repeatable, set-and-forget cooking, this is an amazing tool.  Here are links to the two I own:

* [6 quart Instant Pot Duo60](http://a.co/d/bgTezfE)
* [3 quart Instant Pot Lux Mini](http://a.co/d/8FuKMQR)

### Substitutes

For garlic cloves, I sometimes sub in minced garlic.
