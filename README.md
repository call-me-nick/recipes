# Recipes

This is a collection of personal recipes.

Most of these recipes came from someone else, but have been changed in different ways to suit our tastes or needs.

The Pumpkin Pie recipe is an old one with some special requirements that we had, at the time.  Take a look. It's kind of an interesting story.

## Goals and Style

For the impatient, use the `Instant_Pot/Chili.md` file as a reference.

The recipes should follow the listed goals and style guidelines:

* The recipe should have few steps and be easy to complete.

* The H1 level should be the name of the recipe. Just after that, put in any attributions, reference links, or personal notes in this section.

* H2 level labels should be the most basic summary instruction for the section. ie: "Prepare", "Mix", "Preheat", "Saute", "Pressure Cook", etc...

* In order to make shopping easier, each ingredient should be listed in a table, with the ingredient in the first column, and the amount in the second column.  Tables should not be used for anything else.  eg:

| *ingredient* | *amount* |
| --- | --- |
| diced tomatoes | two ~14 oz cans **or** fresh diced tomatoes |
| tomato sauce | one ~14 oz can |
| salt | 1/2 tablespoon |

* Measurements should be **completely** spelled out, to avoid confusion.

* Try not to use bogus ingredients like: "1 packet of taco seasoning" This is **not** an ingredient.  However, spices sometimes come in mixes, such as Guaram Masala.  This is fine.

## Notes

The following are notes that may be useful to the reader.

### Ingredients

*Onions* - `Since onions come in different sizes, what do you mean by 1/2 an onion?` An onion the size of a baseball is 1/2 of an onion. An onion slightly smaller than a softball is a whole onion.

### Instant Pot

If you don't own one, you're really missing out. For excellent, repeatable, set-and-forget cooking, this is an amazing tool.  Here are links to the two I own:

* [6 quart Instant Pot Duo60](http://a.co/d/bgTezfE)
* [3 quart Instant Pot Lux Mini](http://a.co/d/8FuKMQR)

### Substitutes

For garlic cloves, I sometimes sub in minced garlic.
